## Project Reflection

### Development Process

#### Step 1: Project Setup
I began by setting up the project structure with three main HTML files (index.html, about.html, contact.html) and integrated Bootstrap 5 via CDN. I also included Bootstrap Icons for enhanced visual elements.

#### Step 2: Bootstrap 5 Exploration
I thoroughly explored Bootstrap 5's official documentation and examples to understand the available components. I focused on:
- Navigation components (navbar)
- Layout components (grid, cards, containers)
- Form components (inputs, validation)
- Interactive components (accordion, buttons)
- Utility classes for styling

#### Step 3: Component Selection and Remixing
Rather than copying entire example pages, I carefully selected individual components and remixed them to create original, cohesive designs:
- **Navbar**: Customized with company branding and smooth hover effects
- **Cards**: Used for features, team members, and contact information
- **Forms**: Created comprehensive contact form with validation
- **Accordion**: Implemented for FAQ section
- **Grid System**: Used throughout for responsive layouts

#### Step 4: Page Development

**Home Page Development:**
- Created an engaging hero section with gradient background
- Implemented features section using Bootstrap cards
- Added statistics section with animated elements
- Designed comprehensive footer with multiple columns

#### Step 5: Custom Styling and Enhancement
I created a comprehensive custom CSS file (styles.css) that includes:
- CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Responsive design optimizations
- Accessibility improvements
- Print-friendly styles

#### Step 6: Responsiveness and Testing
I ensured the website works perfectly across all device sizes by:
